<h3>About</h3>
<h4>November 1991 - current</h4>

<p>
I'm a <span class="small_caps">Gameplay Engineer</span> at <a href="https://pocketgems.com/">Pocket Gems</a> in San Francisco. Starting in 2012, I cut my teeth on a few of the company's <a href="pg_ship.html">shipped titles</a> and then moved on to R&D <a href="pg_proto.html">prototype games</a>. I've worked in iOS with Objective-C as well as Unity with C#, with a brief foray into Unreal Engine with C++ and Blueprints. My focus is bringing game designs to life and providing the tooling that the team needs. <!-- My favorite language used to be C++11, but I'm most familiar with C# now.-->
</p>

<p>
As a kid, I spent an inordinate amount of time playing the classics: 
<em>Super Mario 64</em> (1996),
<em>Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction</em> (2001), and
<em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> (2001).
I was also a big fan of
<em>Zelda: Wind Waker</em> (2002), and
my fastest <em>Cave Story</em> (2004) Sacred Grounds time was 3'39"3.
In the 2010's, I enjoyed
<em>Pok&eacute;mon XY</em> (2013),
both <em>Dark Souls</em> (2011) and <em>III</em> (2016) (I skipped <em>II</em>),
the couch co-op of <em>Overcooked</em> (2016),
<em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> (2017), and
<em>Hades</em> (2018).
Most recently, I've played a lot of <em>Elden Ring</em> (2022).
</p>

<p>
Aside from game development, I play the piano (and a little guitar), do gymnastics, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/breakfastegg/">cook lots of breakfast fry-ups</a>. I've also done a small amount of <a href="art2d-design.html">design</a> and <a href="art2d-illustration.html">illustration</a> work in my spare time.

<h5>Academics</h5>

<p>
I studied computer science at UT Austin, completing the Turing Scholars honors program in 2012. In the absence of a game development track (which was <a href="http://gamedev.utexas.edu/">rolled out in 2013</a>), I took <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/fussell/courses/cs378-spring2012/">CS 378: Game Technology</a>, the first game-development class offered at the school, as well as <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/courses/379h-computer-sciences-honors-thesis/">CS 379H: Honors Thesis</a>, where I wrote <a href="thesis.html">a thesis</a> on the physical simulation of vegetation. In the process, I also developed a <a href="umbrella.html">toy physics engine</a> (check it out on <a href="https://github.com/tsornin/ys-umbrella">GitHub</a>!).

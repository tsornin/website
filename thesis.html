<h3>Honors Thesis</h3>
<h4>May 2012</h4>

<p>
Honors students at UT Austin complete a thesis (CS 379H) or become covered in shame and graduate as non-honors poseurs. The thesis is a bit smaller in scope than, say, a master's thesis. I did mine under advisor <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~fussell/">Fussell</a> and second reader <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lin/">Lin</a>. My thesis was about simulating trees in real time. It involved a lot of game loop, physics, and graphics nonsense.
</p>

<p>
In retrospect, as a research work I spent little time examining prior work and too much time hand-rolling my own physics. No regrets though, was great for learning how to fucking code.

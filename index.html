<p>
Piano player, gymnastics doer, and physics simulation maker.
In my spare time I also do some
<a href="art2d.html">2D design</a>.
A few years ago I also did some
<a href="3d.html">3D modeling</a>.
</p>

<p>
I was born to make video games. Or, well interactive art running at 60fps.
</p>

<p>
I grew up in Texas, which is flat, gray, and sad. When I was 10 I lived in Shanghai for two years and learned secret ninja skills.

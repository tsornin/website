		> 2012 was the first year AMD sponsored the cash prize for best thesis; as a result they made the last call for the winner, where in previous years it was probably just lin
		> they didn't like my thesis, no quantitative results

	story: this was built as C++11 was being rolled out. i used to be quite the C++ devotee; i still have some thoughts about it, mostly the standard ones

	these are some interesting problems i encountered. at pocket-gems (where i spent a lot of time thinking about engineering interviewing), i tried to tap them for interview questions, but they're too specific to be useful.
		"caltrops" algorithm
		constraint based impulse physics (pgs solver)
		convex collision (separating axis theorem, minkowski)
		aabb collision (direct, minkowski)
		double graph
		contact graph (island detection with modified cc)
		verlets and the ground
		exponential camera

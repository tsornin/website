<h3>CS 373: Week 8</h3>
<h4>23 October 2011</h4>

<p>
This week, we finished
<a href="https://zweb.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/drupal/node/12">Project 4: WC1</a>.
Although I didn't contribute a lot for Phase 1,
I am excited about
<a href="https://zweb.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/drupal/node/15">Project 5: WC2</a>,
where the static HTML pages will be replaced by dynamic HTML.
Ever since I coded
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~tsornin/">this</a>
website, I've wanted to see how dynamic HTML works.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the last exam, I made a cheat-sheet for Test 2.
This sheet was almost entirely about the
<a href="http://www.tomjewett.com/dbdesign/dbdesign.php">Database Design</a>
book, since I've been behind on reading these last couple of weeks.
However, the exam was almost all coding questions.
Some people had complaints about the limited amout of time on the exam,
which I agree with, especially since the class isn't graded on a curve.
Personally, I didn't have any problems with the time limit.
I answered all except one of the coding questions,
although I'm not 100% sure that all my answers were correct.
The one coding question I didn't figure out was the second <code>zip</code> function.

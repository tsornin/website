<h3>CS 373: Week 10</h3>
<h4>6 November 2011</h4>

<p>
This week, my team finished up
<a href="https://zweb.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/drupal/node/15">Project 5: WC2</a>.
It looks like most of the big project is finished,
with only a search function and a presentation remaining.
Originally, I wanted to clean up the website handlers
(they could all be in one file!),
but it doesn't seem necessary
(so much for refactoring).
There's not much to do in front-end for a search bar functionality, either.
(We actually had a dummy search bar earlier, but we removed it to avoid confusion.)

Besides that,

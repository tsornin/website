<h3>CS 373: Week 7</h3>
<h4>17 October 2011</h4>

<p>
I missed class last Friday.
Unfortunately, this was the class which discussed Project 4.
Now, I am behind on both readings and project know-how.
Also, I've been very busy with other things this week,
to the detriment of my team participation.
</p>

<p>
For Project 4, I typed up some static HTML pages.
I can't wait until the pages are dynamically generated.
In particular, I suspect I might be able to get away with
only using two types of pages for people, organizations and events.

<h3>CS 373: Week 6</h3>
<h4>9 October 2011</h4>

<p>
A rather hectic week, stuffed full of interviews.
</p>

<h5>Monday</h5>
<p>
My partner and I worked on Project 3 a little.
We threw around some ideas for an improved cache,
but didn't get much done.
</p>

<h5>Tuesday</h5>
<p>
We started writing a program to build a "cluster cache".
Our "cluster cache" would partition all the customers into several disjoint clusters,
and would also compute the average ratings for all movies of each cluster.
Disjoint groups with distant ratings are produced by randomly seeding several clusters,
and then averaging each new customer into the cluster with the lowest RMSE against that customer.
We implemented the program in Java; however, it read files very slowly,
and I never saw it terminate afterwards.
That night, I went home and re-implemented the cluster cache program in C++.
This program ran much faster:
It chewed through files
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxyZaZlaOs">
FASTER LIKE THE SPEED OF SOUND</a>.
The clustering appeared to be a success,
with a RMSE of over 2.3 for the two most distant clusters.
</p>

<h5>Wednesday</h5>
<p>
We hooked up the cluster cache to our main program.
The result was a RMSE score of 0.9432, lower than the "goal" rating of 0.9474.
However, this cache would be difficult to use against the real qualifying data,
since it looks up customers by ID.
On a real data set, a new customer would have to be matched to a cluster.
This would slow down the program considerably;
all the customer's ratings would have to be gathered and stored
for the RMSE computation against clusters
(since the ratings are stored in a per-movie format).
</p>

<p>
Wednesday night, I attended the Apple-Turing dinner.
Ironically, towards the end of the event,
I received a text message informing me that Steve Jobs died. R.I.P. Steve.
</p>

<h5>Thursday</h5>
<p>
Two interviews with Apple in the morning.
In the afternoon, my partner finished up some unit tests and submitted Project 3.
I was unable to help, as I was on a plane to California for an interview with
<a href="http://pocketgems.com">Pocket Gems</a>,
a mobile game company with an impressive
<a href="http://pocketgems.com/about/fast-facts">pile of achievements</a>.
</p>

<h5>Friday</h5>
<p>
The on-site interview with Pocket Gems was a lot longer than expected:
I spoke with two hiring managers and four engineers.
It was a long interview session,
and while I managed to solve the coding problems,
I felt I answered very slowly.
</p>

<p>
Even with a large list of things on my TODO-list
(mostly from all the hours spent traveling to and from California),
I'm still looking forward to working on the next projects in this class
with a large group of five teammates.

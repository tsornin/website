<h3>CS 373: Week 14</h3>
<h4>4 November 2011</h4>

<p>
Overall impressions.
</p>

<p>
Class lectures were very engaging,
thanks to both the content and the "hot seat" questioning.
The parallel Java and Python code provided was clear and informative,
covering rules and nuances of both languages in great detail.
However, in terms of the UT CS degree plan,
these detailed lectures seemed a bit overdue &mdash;
maybe because this is my penultimate semester at UT.
I wish I had taken this class earlier;
I'm surprised it's not a suggested class for second- or third-year students.
The "hot seat" questioning format was interesting,
although some questions seemed all too easy
(I answered my hot-seat questions correctly straight out of a nap on more than one occasion).
</p>

<p>
The projects were the best part of the course;
they were meaningful and organized logically.
The first two projects served well as a Python warm-up.
However, when I got stuck on the code,
the teaching assistants were not very helpful, and
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~tsornin/cs373-week2.html">SPOJ was a bad teaching tool</a>.
The last three projects were very fun to work on,
and also my first experience working on software in a team.
</p>

<p>
Compared to the projects and lectures, the exams weren't so great &mdash;
they were just a pile of unrelated and unfamiliar topics.
In particular, Haskell (second exam) and UML (third exam) were unfair,
since neither of these topics had appeared in a previous assignment.
I had no practice writing Haskell code or drawing UML diagrams.
In fact, the entire (small) Haskell portion of the class seems unnecessary.
The funny language was covered as an afterthought to the parallel Java and Python code,
and wholly abandoned by the last third of the class.
</p>

<p>
I didn't enjoy the quizzes for this class.
Like the exams, the topics were unpredictable.
Besides complaints about quiz content,
I don't like classes that enforce attendance with sign-ins or daily quizzes
(the five-quiz rule was particularly draconian).
Sometimes, skipping a class to work on other things is beneficial,
so the decision to attend class should be the student's.
</p>

<p>
Despite my several gripes about the class,
my overall impression of this class has been very positive:
</p>

<blockquote>
I liked the part where they actually taught us how to code.

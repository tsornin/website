<h3>CS 373: Week 4</h3>
<h4>26 September 2011</h4>

<p>
My partner and I finished
<a href="https://zweb.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/drupal/node/10">
Project 2: PFD</a> last week,
so all I had to do this week was study for the exam.
</p>

<p>
Keeping in mind that the cheat sheet would be "useless",
I scribbled down some notes but did not bring them to the exam.
Most of the exam was fair enough,
but I felt that the question about enabling Python assertions
was definitely a "cheat-sheet" sort of question, especially
since we had never needed to turn off assertions in an assignment.
The programming questions felt quite easy, though.
</p>

<p>
Besides the exam,
<a href="https://zweb.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/drupal/node/11">
Project 3</a> is out, which I'm looking forward to.
It seems like a more ambitious programming assignment,
and we have less time to work on it,
since it was assigned on a test week and hasn't been covered in class yet.

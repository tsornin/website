<h3>CS 373: Week 1</h3>
<h4>4 September 2011</h4>

<p>
It was 10:00 PM on Sunday and I was going to write a blog post about my new favorite CS class,
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~downing/cs373" target="_new">CS 373: "Software Engineering"</a>
with Professor
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~downing/" target="_new">Glenn P. Downing</a>.
These blog posts were assigned no doubt to assess student opinion of the class and get some useful feedback.
</p>
<ul>At first, my head was filled with ideas about what I would blog about:
	<li>How I had already read several of the assigned readings on pair programming;</li>
	<li>How the "hot seat" lecture questions encouraged (nay, forced) participation;</li>
	<li>How afraid I was that git would eat my files;</li>
	<li>How nervous I was when using a typeless language like Python;</li>
	<li>How I could apply these new toolchains in Real Life.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I thought that only a few overachieving students would write blogs about a class.
But I underestimated the allure of those ten extra credit points.
As I procrastinated, and blog post after blog post popped up on Piazza,
I realized that I was not a very beautiful or unique snowflake.
Many of the things I wanted to say about the class had already been said,
probably more elegantly than I could say them, by my classmates.
</p>

<p>
In fact, I figured that my blog would end up looking like a regurgitation of everyone else's thoughts.
Fortunately, I had just the tool for such a job:
Two years ago in Professor
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lin/" target="_new">Calvin Lin</a>'s
CS 315H class,
I was assigned a "Random Writing" project:
a program which chewed on input files and randomly produced text
similar to the input files.
The remainder of this blog post is composed of (almost) all the other CS 373 blogs out there,
largely thanks to <code>RandomWriter.java</code>.

<h5>Random Thoughts on CS 373: Week 1</h5>

<em>

<p>
To receive any points, I must pass the s'll get to see many of the advantages and glad that for once I will be learning thn accepted, which surprised me. I reallyld be some way of informing the entire clted. That will change this semester. MyCS 373 was a tough course but I needed a edditor the first thing that came to mindhose details more meaningful, rather thans meant to mimic the process we will haveoftware engineering’ actually is.
</p>

<p>
This is what separates Software Engineering from Intro to Programming. In fact, this be implemented by the developers. Frequent releases. I agree with pretty much all ol of these required tools at the same time. However, that's not the only reason.
</p>

<p>
I know Downing stated he would show us it a good driver for the tools we need to learn. Particularly Git/Assembla and issue tracking on Go engineering practice and puts them together very elegantly.
</p>

<p>
PS... Favorite the Collatz Problem( 3n + 1 problem) is much more than just turning in some code. It's purpose is tot this class. Let's get right to it. I like the class so far. The lectures, project, and readings hae and fit for me, because he go over every single like and single things, so it is good to understandous courses were all based on theory or algorithms.
</p>

<p>
The first project is going well so far. I about, most of this week was really dediIt must pass the Sphere Online Judge (SPO so (I imagine) to those who are completeever alone guy meme. Professor Downing appens to be fast--well it just means the  love his teaching methods (Previous blogse to say since I've said it all before.
</p>

<p>
we kicked off this week with readings on is set up the way it is.  I'm happy thatts as of yet, although I tend to fault mydid leave the first class feeling overwher things aren't so bad because its startig in and making me pick up all the Lego'sre all good skills to have, and am glad t that we will use throughout the semesters, which seems better suited for freshmaniate happiness.
</p>

<p>
I am alome and gone. And I’ll be honest with you. I think this class will provide the practical application that most other UT computer science coursrces. So the first week of cs373 (aka Software Engineering) has come and gone. And I’ll be honest wive. You needlessly steepens the curve, as students struggle to write the program while trying to learseriously, as I sit here watching a Star Wars: a New Hope while trying to recall this week's crazy shzes. I did not like the quiz today, I believe it was to detailed for 90+ pages of reading.
</p>

<p>
I had been using Bitbucket to host my personal projects, but I'd ratskills as part of the project. There's a nagginthis case, cycle length refers to the num’ I don’t mean mindlessly solving a problming the entire class whenever a student etimes just one really big Lego block.  Pnxiety!

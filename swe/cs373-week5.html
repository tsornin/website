<h3>CS 373: Week 5</h3>
<h4>2 October 2011</h4>

<p>
My (new) partner and I haven't
<a href="https://zweb.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/drupal/node/11">
Project 3</a> yet.
So far, we produced the average-customer-rating and average-movie-rating caches.
Using a weighted average of these two values for a customer-movie key
produces an RMSE of around 1.003.
Of course, this isn't enough for the assignment requirements.
If it were, that might actually be a little disappointing!
On the other hand, I'm hoping that hitting the RMSE < 1.0 mark
won't require a very involved caching scheme.

I'm starting to like Python
(I actually wrote Python-like pseudo-code in my interviews last week!),
but there have yet to be any Haskell projects, and
I still have no idea what a useful Haskell program looks like.

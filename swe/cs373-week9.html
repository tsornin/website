<h3>CS 373: Week 9</h3>
<h4>30 October 2011</h4>

<p>
Not much happened in class this week.
</p>

<p>
This week, I continued my front-end duties for
<a href="https://zweb.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/drupal/node/15">Project 5: WC2</a>,
setting up the <code>app.yaml</code> configuration file
and creating dynamic pages to display information from the database dynamically.
</p>

<p>
Originally, I planned on only using two template pages, "Entity" and "List".
"Entity" pages would be parametrized to display individual crises, persons, or organizations,
while "List" pages would be parametrized to display all crises, persons, or organizations collected.
I was successful with the latter, but not the former.
Currently, I am using different templates for individual entities.
Even so, there seems to be a lot of duplicate code among the three types of entity pages &mdash;
plenty of opportunity for refactoring.
</p>

<p>
Every page on our website displays a header/navbar and footer.
This is handled by scripts as well.
Currently there are several scripts for different types of pages
(entity, list, test, error),
so again, there is some duplicated code in each script
to print out the header and footer, which I would like to refactor.
</p>

<p>
I haven't touched any back-end code up until this week,
but I had to examine the models based on the schema.
The chosen schema seems to have some flaws...
</p>

<p>
Locations are modeled as global coordinates and an optional street address,
and all entities have this same type of location.
This seems like a bad design to me, since these are two very different kinds of "location".
A natural disaster such as an earthquake or a flood would have global coordinates,
but no street address;
on the other hand, a person usually has a home address,
and it makes no sense to pinpoint a moving person as a global coordinate.
</p>

<p>
The other gripe I have against the schema concerns the name of a person.
It's not about the fact that people have compound names,
while crises and organizations have a single string for a name;
the problem is that there is no middle-name field in a person's name,
making it impossible to display
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">
the forty-third president of the United States</a>'
name in its full glory.

	Worked closely with artists, product managers, and QA on both build and live games. Seamlessly assumed and improved team engineering conventions. Delivered new features and bugfixes with minimal direction, shipping several casual and hardcore portfolio games:
</p>
<ul>
	<!-- story: bad offshore code optimization -->
	<li>Tap Pet Hotel - maintained live game on a weekly agile release cycle</li> <!-- 6/2012 to 12/2012 -->
	<!-- story: wildcatz died to bad pivoting but guilds returned in dragons -->
	<!-- story: the posessed ipad -->
	<li>Epic Empire - designed "guilds" API with server team; independently added a "barbershop" feature</li> <!-- 1/2013 to 5/2014 -->
	<!-- story: semi-lead dynamics -->
	<!-- story: refactor vs rebuild -->
	<li>Runway Life - start-to-finish refactor and reskin of an existing game</li> <!-- 5/2014 to 2/2014 -->

	story: this was built as C++11 was being rolled out. i used to be quite the C++ devotee; i still have some thoughts about it, mostly the standard ones

	these are some interesting problems i encountered, sorted by difficulty. at pocket-gems (where i spent a lot of time thinking about engineering interviewing), i tried to tap them for interview questions, but they're too specific to be useful.

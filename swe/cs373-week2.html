<h3>CS 373: Week 2</h3>
<h4>11 September 2011</h4>

<p>
No random writer this week.
Maybe I could make a script to automate random writing everyone's blogs...
</p>

<p>
I'm actually enjoying the many different tools this class emphasizes.
They are all very practical tools used in Real Life
so I am interested in them beyond just résumé stuffing.
For example, just today I read that the makers of
<a href="http://www.amnesiagame.com/#main">
Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a>, Frictional Games,
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/k9vwj/we_are_frictional_games_creators_of_amnesia_the/c2ila4d">
doesn't have an office and uses daily SVN commits</a> to get things done.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, the issue tracker is useful. While working on
<a href="https://zweb.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/drupal/node/9">
Project 1</a>, I was surprised how well it replaced my usual
text-file todo-list.
</p>

<p>
I'm still confused about how the graders are verifying that programs work on Sphere,
since Sphere usually wants programs in a special format.
Do they use scripts to re-arrange submitted programs?
</p>

<p>
While I like the projects, I have mixed feelings about Sphere.
While unhelpful error messages like "NZEC" and "Wrong Answer"
may suitable for competition-style grading,
they also promote "learning the hard way" and
force students to blindly rewrite their programs —
sometimes not because of logical errors,
but just to cope with the SPOJ's many idiosyncrasies.
</p>

<p>
I also remain unconvinced that pair programming is the panacea
for software development the authors of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Installed-Ron-Jeffries/dp/0201708426">
Extreme Programming Installed</a> think it is.
However, I do think it's very useful for tasks with many small deliverables — exactly what
<a href="https://zweb.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/drupal/node/10">
Project 2</a> asks for.

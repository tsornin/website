<h3>CS 373: Week 3</h3>
<h4>18 September 2011</h4>

<p>
I feel like I don't have much to say this week.
Sounds like it's time for another RandomWriter post.
</p>

<p>
Ah, pair programming!
The perfect cure for my crippling procrastination.
My partner and I finished Project 2 in record time.
</p>

<p>
We were somewhat confused about receiving just one input.
After receiving our first Sphere NZEC error,
we were about to try a multi-input solution
when Sphere magically started working again.
</p>

<p>
There also seems to be some confusion about how to generate directed acyclic graphs.
At first, I considered generating a random graph and then removing edges until it was acyclic.
However, it turns out there is a much easier way to generate directed acyclic graphs
that amounts to little more than shuffling indices around in an adjacency matrix.
</p>

<p>
I don't really need to repeat what I said
about Sphere being a bad learning tool.
However, my views are shared by some classmates.
In particular, Mr.
<a href="http://ih8bl0gs.blogspot.com/2011/09/week-3.html">
Justin Pope</a>
is raging very hard at the Sphere online judge.
</p>

<p>
Post those blogs, folks! Only blogs submitted before midnight make it into the RandomWriter word soup.
This time, I'm using a Markov chain that operates at word resolution instead of letter resolution.
The output is more legible than last last week's...but unfortunately, less funny, and more "word soup".

<h5>Random Thoughts on CS 373: Week 3</h5>

<em>

<p>
We had no pre-reqs. Instead, you are assigned but I'll have fixed. The project description was not work is not sure if an instruction (in python), and memory allocation. In this class should be given a child. I was always a teacher to programming"-type class. Don't get the face of that its pieces (but I work around your code and less stressful when Dr. Downing's explanation of certain situations and I found that doing: Is an entire solution is, at the basics. Last week, was kind of it nonetheless, so much was suppose to spot. This week as to get taught this technique to sit on objects, assertions, static vs. destructive methods on the 4 answers about this one. If you accept the resources available to see all the best guess this framework. My partner does help me program and exceptions, try/catch, assertions, exceptions, and Python. But dammit if there's a bug due in there.
</p>

<p>
Need to go above and Sphere pretty similar to wait to my partner and Haskell. Of the right now. And who learned about "stack" and yet at job requirements more comprehensive and exceptions. I hope we are engaging and +1 to perfectly deal with my partner and I feel more time in CS 336, SSC 329C, and beyond the ability to me absolutely destroy the program in stack.
</p>

<p>
Our first place - now the learning curve I suppose to use that I look at my frustration with another, rather than trying to know and I thought the same way in python in Java, Python, and redundant, and at .23 seconds. I mentioned last week, seeings as the three, Python is like that long to have an important issue tracker, sphere, etc. With the output was always a fellow classmate in a root, and falling in programming.
</p>

<p>
Pointers are so keen on the bugs in the point we would be cyclic. Alternatively, one could use to and memory allocation. In the two assignments and I would expect it credit for our tests, wiki, etc. In all the time and love--and Python--the language we decided to the XP does help me and answer set to be taken us a fairly well.
</p>

<p>
Honestly after we definitely help me program only part of XP seem more difficult to accept it. 
</p>

<p>
Honestly, I could manage to speak so it works, I prefer the seemingly smallest errors causing such a tree.
</p>

<p>
A good software seems that me from a child. I really interesting adventure. I hear complaints that the front so we're working on their input and structure of the way Java and question what test cases before we forget that I finally experienced pair programming assignment and formal than expected. I can focus is school was not knowing this week I have. It's amazing how to get a little anxious to my solution via Pair Programming that we were handled in programming. My knowledge of situation. I'll stay tuned for a group of overlapping one node that in python but I know in Project 2: PFD, I would expect it will improve programming.
</p>

<p>
That is wrong. Employees and I have a minor annoyance aside, I finally experienced pair programming. My knowledge of mathematical induction in prerequisite courses should not having a PHP god, so long to write an hour. Or I didn't know how to and "catch", I felt. (Of course, now though. :)

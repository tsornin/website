Previously, I studied computer science at UT Austin, completing the Turing Scholars honors program. In the absence of a game development track (which was <a href="http://gamedev.utexas.edu/">rolled out in 2013</a>), I took <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/fussell/courses/cs378-spring2012/">CS 378: Game Technology</a>, the first game-related class offered at the school, as well as <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/courses/379h-computer-sciences-honors-thesis/">CS 379H: Honors Thesis</a>, where I wrote <a href="thesis.html">a thesis</a> about physical simulation of vegetation.

Aside from coding, I'm a piano player, gymnastics doer, and smoothie maker; I also do <a href="art2d.html">2D design work</a> in my spare time.
